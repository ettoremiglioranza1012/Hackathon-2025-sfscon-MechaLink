# Workflow
1. Create your branch using `git checkout -b <your-name>/<feature>`
2. Work on your first commit and as soon as you are done, push to your branch.
3. At this point, open a pull request so that everyone knows what you are working on.
4. When you are done with developing your feature, test it and make sure it works as intended. Then review the pull request and accept it (possibly someone should review it).

## Commit Tags
It is useful to use specific tags for each commit, so that the message is as descriptive as possible.
- `feat`: to indicate the inclusion of a new feature.
- `chore`: boring stuff like deleting useless files.
- `refactor`: when you change file names or functions to organize the project better.
- `docs`: when you include new documentation in your project.
